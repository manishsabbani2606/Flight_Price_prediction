# Flight_Price_prediction

 Flight Price Prediction â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA Only)
This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a flight price dataset to uncover key factors that influence ticket pricing. The goal of this project is to extract insights and visualize patterns in the data without building a predictive model.

**Key Highlights:**
Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Analysis of how Airline, Number of Stops, Source, Destination, and Duration affect flight prices

Clean and intuitive visualizations (boxplots, bar charts, heatmaps, etc.)

Feature transformation examples such as:

Extracting journey day and month from travel dates

Cleaning and converting duration times into numeric format

 **Techniques Used:**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Parsing and converting date/time fields

**Visualizations:**

Histograms & KDE plots

Boxplots and bar charts

Correlation heatmaps

Count plots for categorical features

**Tools & Libraries:**
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn
